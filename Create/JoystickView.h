 *  JoystickView.h
 *
 *  The JoystickView class can be used to control the various Controllers. It
 *  provides a widget which can be controlled by the mouse and provides all
 *  the appropriate slots and signals. The joystick has two yokes: x and y,
 *  which in turn can be used for control. Furthermore, it can be customized
 *  to force exclusive yokes ï¿½ a mode where only one of the yokes can be moved
 *  at a time. In addition, the JoystickView class also provides control over its
 *  acceleration and deceleration, a useful feature for gently controlling a robot.
